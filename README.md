# BlockDestroyer
## About ####
- A breakout-like game I created in Unity.  
- The goal of the game is to survive and break blocks by bouncing the ball off the paddle.

## Game Mechanics ##
- You control the paddle with your mouse.
- Each level is procedurally generated so that the blocks appear random each time, thus increasing the replay value.

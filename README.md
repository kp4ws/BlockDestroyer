# BlockDestroyer
## About ##
- A breakout-like game I created in Unity.  
- The goal of the game is to survive and break blocks by bouncing the ball off the paddle.

## Controls ##
- Control the paddle with your mouse.
- Launch the ball with left mouse click.

## Game Mechanics ##
- Each level is procedurally generated so that the blocks appear random each time, thus increasing the replay value.
- When all the blocks are destroyed, a count down timer will start signalling the next wave of blocks to generate.
